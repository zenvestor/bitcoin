<h1>Bitcoin: Threats and Opportunities</h1>

<h2>Threats</h2>

<ol>
<li>
 Competition: A coin with better characteristics might take over.
</li>

<li>
 The law: Governments might make crypto currencies illegal.
</li>

<li>
 Interest rate: If Governments raise interest rates, all
 other assets will lose value. Including Bitcoin.
</li>

<li>
 Internal problems: People in power can
 change the money distribution via
 social engineering. See the Ethereum fork related
 to the DAO in 2016.
</li>

<li>
 Storage: If you store your secret key yourself, you might lose it
 in one way or another. If you let others hold it for you,
 they might lose it and go bankrupt.
</li>

</ol>

<h2>Opportunities</h2>

<ol>

<li>
 Banks: Currently it is complicated to buy bitcoin. If normal
 banks or Paypal would sell it, this would dramatically lower
 the barrier for retail investors. Paypal already offers to
 hold Bitcoin for users in the USA.
</li>

<li>
 Companies: It might become common practice for companies to
 hold some part of their cash in Bitcoin. Ark invest estimated
 that if the S&P500 would hold one percent of their cash in
 Bitcoin, this would double Bitcoins market cap.
</li>

<li>
 Store of value: If Bitcoin becomes a store of value
 half as popular as Gold, this would raise Bitcoins
 price by roughly a factor of five.
</li>

<li>
 Inflation: Nobody knows how the current zero
 interest experiment of the USA and Europe will end.
 If it ends in hyperinflation, Bitcoin would rise
 relative to the Dollar and the Euro dramatically.
</li>
 
<li>
 Payments: With new technologies like the lightning
 network, Bitcoin could become a currency for day to day
 payments. If it becomes the new world currency, then
 it might become worth as much as all money in existence.
</li>

</ol>
